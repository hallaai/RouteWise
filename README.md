# üó∫Ô∏è RouteWise Scheduler

RouteWise Scheduler is an intelligent, web-based application designed to streamline field service management. It provides a powerful platform for optimally assigning tasks to workers (targets), generating efficient daily schedules, and visualizing routes on an interactive map.

The application takes into account numerous constraints such as worker skills, availability, working hours, task priorities, and location to create optimized schedules that minimize travel time and maximize productivity.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **üéØ Task and Target Management:** Easily load operational data. Upload tasks and workers from a JSON file or manage them directly through the user interface.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Schedule Generation:** With a single click, generate a comprehensive, multi-day schedule. The system assigns tasks to the most suitable targets based on skills, availability, and location.
-   **üöó Intelligent Route Optimization:** The scheduling algorithm minimizes travel time by sequencing tasks in a geographically logical order, calculating travel durations based on a configurable vehicle speed.
-   **üìä Comprehensive Reporting:** A dedicated "Report" tab provides a detailed breakdown of the generated schedule, including:
    -   An **Overall Summary** with total tasks, distance, and a pie chart visualizing the distribution of time between tasks, travel, and idle periods.
    -   A **Daily Breakdown** of key performance metrics.
    -   A **Breakdown by Target** to analyze individual worker efficiency.
-   **üóìÔ∏è Interactive Schedule View:** Visualize the entire schedule on a dynamic timeline. Each target's day is displayed as a horizontal bar, with colored blocks representing tasks and travel time.
-   **üìç Interactive Map View:** See all task locations plotted on an interactive map, with clustering for easy navigation. Filter tasks to see all, scheduled, or unscheduled items.
-   **üîß Customizable Settings:** Fine-tune the scheduling engine's parameters, such as vehicle speed, travel time considerations, and working day extensions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### The Route Optimization Algorithm

The core of the application is its sophisticated scheduling and routing engine. It employs a multi-stage process to ensure both correct task assignment and high efficiency.

1.  **Data Ingestion & Task Expansion:** The user selects a date range and the sets of tasks and targets to be scheduled. The system then identifies all occurrences of these tasks within the selected range, accounting for recurring tasks (e.g., weekly maintenance).

2.  **Two-Pass Greedy Assignment:** The engine uses a two-pass greedy algorithm to assign tasks day by day. This ensures recurring tasks are prioritized.
    -   **Pass 1 (Recurring Tasks):** It first schedules all recurring tasks, ensuring these fixed commitments are placed on the calendar.
    -   **Pass 2 (Daily Tasks):** It then schedules the remaining daily (non-recurring) tasks. For each daily task, the algorithm evaluates all available and qualified workers to find the **best fit**. The best fit is the worker who can perform the task with the minimum "cost," calculated as a combination of travel time and potential idle time. This task-centric approach ensures that workers with non-standard hours (e.g., part-timers) are utilized effectively.

3.  **Two-Way Packing Optimization:** After the initial assignments are made, a final optimization pass runs to "pack" the schedule and minimize idle time.
    -   **Backward Pass:** Starting from the end of each worker's day, the algorithm pushes tasks as late as possible, closing gaps before tasks that have a fixed `startTime`. This prevents long, unnecessary waits.
    -   **Forward Pass:** It then performs a forward pass from the start of the day, pulling tasks as early as possible to fill any remaining idle slots. This "squeezes" the schedule from both directions, resulting in a tightly packed and efficient workday.

4.  **Schedule Validation:** Throughout the process, every assignment is validated against constraints like worker skills, task time windows (`startTime`, `endTime`), and the worker's shift hours.

### Unscheduled Task Handling

If some tasks cannot be scheduled within the standard working day, the application prompts the user with the option to automatically extend the working day and re-run the simulation to fit the remaining tasks.

## üìã Task & Target Parameters

To achieve optimal results, the application considers a rich set of parameters for both tasks and targets.

### Task Properties
-   **Location**: The geographical coordinates (`lat`, `lng`) of the task.
-   **Duration**: The time in minutes required to complete the task.
-   **Time Window**: Optional `startTime` and `endTime` that define when the task must be performed.
-   **Skills**: A list of required skills to perform the task (e.g., `hygieniapassi`).
-   **Recurrence**: An optional `repeatInterval` (in days) for tasks that need to be done periodically.
-   **Segment**: A category or type for the task (e.g., "Toimiston siivous", "Kotisiivous").

### Target (Worker) Properties
-   **Home Location**: The starting and ending coordinates for the target's workday.
-   **Skills**: A list of skills the target possesses.
-   **Work Schedule**: The target's standard working hours (e.g., `08:00` to `16:00`).

## üß™ Using the Test Data

The project includes a comprehensive test data file, `cleaning_demo_time_shifted.json`, to allow you to immediately see the application's features in action.

1.  **Load the Data:** On the main "Setup" screen, click the **"Upload JSON"** button and select the `cleaning_demo_time_shifted.json` file from the project's root directory.
2.  **Set the Date Range:** The tasks in this file are scheduled for the week of **September 22nd, 2025**. To see them, click the date range picker in the header and select a range that includes this week (e.g., Sep 22, 2025 to Sep 26, 2025).
3.  **Generate the Schedule:** Ensure that tasks and targets are selected in the two main panels, then click the **"Generate Schedule"** button.

You can now explore the generated timeline in the "Schedule" tab, view routes on the "Map," and analyze the efficiency in the "Report" tab.
