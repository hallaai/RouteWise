# **App Name**: RouteWise Scheduler

## Core Features:

- Task Scheduling: Schedule tasks to targets based on availability, skills, and location using a simulated annealing algorithm. Optimize routes considering task duration, travel time, and target schedules. The user can adjust the length of the working day if needed to fit all tasks.
- Route Optimization: Determine the most efficient route for each target based on task locations using a genetic algorithm, considering the option to include or exclude the trip to the first task and from the last task to home. Display routes on a map.
- Task Filtering and Sorting: Allow users to filter and sort tasks in a table view based on various criteria, such as location, task type, and target.
- Target and Task Selection: Enable users to select specific targets (workers) and tasks for scheduling purposes.
- Schedule Visualization: Display the schedule in a clear, visual format, showing tasks assigned to each target over the chosen time interval. Allow users to view daily and weekly schedules.
- Data Import: Import task and target data from a JSON format, as provided.
- Extend working day: Gives the user possibility to extend the working day to fit all the tasks into the worker's schedule.
